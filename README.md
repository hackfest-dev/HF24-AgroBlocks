Hello everyone, we are Team AgroBlocks ,crafting a blockchain technology project to ensure food traceability and transparency. Our endeavor aims to enhance the food industry, fostering trust and reliability in the food supply chain.<br>
#What is the problem?
Ensuring consumer trust in the food supply chain is crucial. However, several challenges persist, such as a lack of transparency, inadequate information about food production, and uncertainty surrounding food quality and safety. Moreover, ineffective information sharing among stakeholders and accountability issues exacerbate these challenges. Our project is dedicated to tackling these issues directly by utilizing blockchain technology to improve food safety and transparency.<br>
#Our Solution<br>
Blockchain technology offers a secure, decentralized ledger storing data in interconnected blocks. Immutable and transparent, it enhances food safety by enabling traceability from farm to fork, minimizing risks and losses. Our project harnesses blockchain for real-time visibility in the food supply chain, fostering collaboration for safety and integrity.<br>
#Tech Stack and Tools<br>
The Solidity code is developed and tested using Remix IDE, Truffle, and Ganache, with interactions facilitated by the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Web3.js library.<br>
#Tracking contract<br>
The Tracking contract in Solidity streamlines shipment management on Ethereum with clarity and efficiency. It structures shipment details within a Shipment format, covering sender and receiver addresses, pickup and delivery times, distance, price, and status. By leveraging the shipments mapping, it links sender addresses to their shipments for easy tracking. Events like ShipmentCreated and ShipmentDelivered offer real-time updates on shipment progress, ensuring stakeholders stay informed.,br>
Facilitating seamless shipment initiation, the contract verifies essential details provided by senders, ensuring payment integrity. Smooth transitions between shipment states, such as from "pending" to "in-transit," are executed meticulously, verifying parameters for progression. Upon delivery, payments are securely processed to senders, affirming completion. This meticulous orchestration fosters transparency and reliability throughout the shipping process.<br>
In addition to managing shipments, the contract offers convenient functions for retrieving shipment details and assessing total shipments associated with specific senders. This comprehensive approach underscores the contract's role as a sophisticated solution for efficient, trustworthy shipment management on the Ethereum blockchain, promoting streamlined operations and fostering confidence in the global shipping industry.<br>
#Scope of Improvements<br>
1.Data Analytics Enhancement<br>
2.Scalability and Interoperability to accommodate growth and integrate with other systems<br>
